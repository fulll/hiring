## [front/react] Github user search

## Instructions

Create a search input text where users can type in and get results straight away, without ENTER keypress or submit button required.
Results will list Github users like the mock below, and must be responsive.

### The subject

1. Query against Github Api: GET https://api.github.com/search/users?q={USER}.
2. Setup a new app using [vite](https://vite.dev/)
3. Try to not add any dependency library. Only testing libraries are accepted.
4. Don't forget to check against modern ways to make HTTP requests on frontend side.
5. Manage edge cases:
   - No results
   - Github api rate limit
   - User type in quickly and going back and forth on his search
