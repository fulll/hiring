## [Algo] Increment a custom Number type

### Instructions

Imagine that you have a custom `Number` type in your app that manage numbers as an array of digits (instead of using the native number type that your language can bring by default).

Some examples:

| number | Number  |
| ------ | ------- |
| 123    | [1,2,3] |
| 99     | [9,9]   |

We want to be able to increment a `Number`.

### Subject

Your mission is to write an `increment` function that adds `1` to the input `Number` and returns the incremented `Number`.

Here's the (language agnostic) prototype of the function:

```
increment(Number number): Number
```

#### Guidelines

- Write it in your favorite language (one of: javascript, php)
- Push your code to a Github repository or any sandbox environment like [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
- Get ready to justify some of your choices for the interview

#### Evaluation

- Quality of the code
- Scalability of the algorithm
- Usage of good practices and modern programming language features
