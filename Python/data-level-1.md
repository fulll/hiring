## [Python/data] Bike Sharing

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for the three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Instructions

- Complete the "to do" lines in the template python file "bike_investigation.py"
- Push your code to a Github repository
- Document what you've done in the code and with a README

### The subject

You will investigate about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.
In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

#4 User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Guidelines

To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bike_investigation.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also.
You will need the three city dataset files that are in the ZIP file éBike_raw_data" :
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Data sets

Randomly selected data from https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 23/06/2017 15:09:32)
- End Time (e.g., 23/06/2017 15:14:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 321)
- Start Station (e.g., Wood St & Hubbard St)
- End Station (e.g., Damen Ave & Chicago Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

### Evaluation

- Quality of the code
- Scalability of the algorithm
- Usage of good practices and modern Python
