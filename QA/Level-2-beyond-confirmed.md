# QA Lead Complementary Exercise – Strategy & Vision

## Context
This exercise is intended **in addition to** the practical test [Level-1-junior-to-confirmed.md](./Level-1-junior-to-confirmed.md).  
It targets senior level, **Lead QA** candidates and beyond, in order to evaluate not only their ability to implement Cypress + Cucumber tests, but also their capacity to define a **QA strategy, structure, and vision** for the team.

## Your Mission

1. **QA Strategy (1–2 pages in README)**
   - Define what should be **automated** vs what should remain **manual** (exploratory, visual regression, accessibility, etc.).  
   - Explain your **prioritization**: which scenarios must be automated first, which can wait, and why.  
   - Describe how you would **integrate the suite into a CI/CD pipeline**, including test selection by tags (e.g., smoke vs regression vs boundary).  

2. **Repository & Team Structure**
   - Propose a **repository organization** for QA automation (files, fixtures, selectors, commands).  
   - Suggest a **naming convention** and a **tagging strategy** for Gherkin features and scenarios.  
   - Indicate how you would structure the test base to be **maintainable** as the product grows.  

3. **Mentoring & Collaboration**
   - Imagine a new **Junior QA** joins the team tomorrow. Outline the **first 2 weeks** of onboarding you would set up.  
   - Explain how you would review their first test PRs and help them progress toward autonomy.  
   - Mention how you would collaborate with Developers and Product Managers to ensure **quality is a shared responsibility**.  

4. **Vision & Continuous Improvement**
   - Propose **metrics** you would track to measure QA effectiveness (e.g., flaky test rate, coverage of critical paths, CI duration).  
   - Suggest one or two **initiatives** to improve the QA culture at fulll (tooling, processes, rituals, documentation).  


## Deliverables

- Extend the `README.md` produced in the first exercise with:  
  - A **QA strategy section**  
  - A **repository & tagging proposal**  
  - An **onboarding/mentoring plan**  
  - A **vision & improvement ideas**  

No strict format is required, but the result should be **structured, concise, and actionable**.

## Evaluation Focus (Lead level)

- Ability to **step back from implementation** and define a **strategic vision**.  
- Clarity and pragmatism in the **QA strategy** (automation priorities, CI integration).  
- Structuring skills (repo, conventions, maintainability).  
- **Leadership mindset**: mentoring, collaboration, improvement initiatives.  
- Communication: clear, concise, usable by a team.
