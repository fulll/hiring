# Level 2 - Define a backlog

We want to evaluate your capability to define a backlog / roadmap pretty high level to respond to a specific audience and specific use case for a new product we could launch about cashflow.

Your target are entrepreneurs / founders of a small company.
We know that cashflow is key to manage their companies, making decision about investment, business strategy, recruitment, reducing costs...

"As an entrepreneur, I want to manage my cashflow in order to..."

From this starting point, we want that you define a product definition by highlighing
- target/audience
- user values
- product promises
- market opportunities
- monetisation (bonus)

After saying that, we can imagine many things to do here, and this can require a lot of work.

Your goal is not to do all of these, but choose your weapons to deliver a high level roadmap prioritized
- by values
- market opportunities
- according to your key audience

Weapons
- interview(s) script
- user workflow
- user story map / feature story map
- lean canvas
- anything else

Use one or several weapons to define your high level backlog prioritized, and explain why you choose this one / these ones. 
Why is even more important that the weapon itself. 

You may use any AI tool to help you speed up writing or get insights. If so, please specify which tool you used, for what purpose(s) and benefit(s) you earned.

## Time required

3h to 4h

## Expectations
- rewrite the speech of the exercise
- provide your delivery with any support: external public link (Miro, Notion, Google Drive...) or simply a PPT/PDF with at least a high level roadmap prioritized and the path you've took to reach this result
- explain your method and why
