# Level 2 - Define a backlog

We want to evaluate your capability to define a backlog / roadmap pretty high level to respond to a specific audience and specific use case for a new product we could launch about cashflow.

Your target are entrepreneurs / founders of a small company.
We know that cashflow is key to manage their companies, making decision about investment, business strategy, recruitment, reducing costs...

"As an entrepreneur, I want to manage my cashflow in order to..."

From this starting point, we want that you define a product definition by highlighing
- target/audience
- user values
- product promises
- market opportunities
- monetisation (bonus)

After saying that, we can imagine many things to do here, and this can require a lot of work.

Your goal is not to do all of these, but choose your weapons to deliver a high level roadmap prioritized
- by values
- market opportunities
- according to your key audience

Weapons
- interview(s) script
- user workflow
- user story map / feature story map
- lean canvas
- anything else

Use one or several weapons to define your high level backlog prioritized, and explain why you choose this one / these ones. 
Why is even more important that the weapon itself. 

## Time required

3h to 4h

## Expectations
- rewrite the speech of the exercise
- provide your delivery with any support: external public link (Miro, Notion, Google Drive...) or simply a PPT/PDF with at least a high level roadmap prioritized and the path you've took to reach this result
- explain your method and why
